##### Task 1: Review lab videos on C programming and RISC-V architecture. Perform the task of compiling C code using both the GCC compiler and the RISC-V compiler, demonstrating an understanding of the compilation process for each.

## C and RISC-V Programming Labs
This repository provides a detailed guide to compiling C programs and generating assembly code using both the standard GCC compiler and the RISC-V GCC compiler. It covers all essential steps and explanations for understanding the compilation and debugging workflows.

### Lab 1: Working with C Language
#### Compiling a .c File Locally
   1. Launch the bash terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your source file.
   2. Use the following command to create and open a new .c file for editing:
      
   ``` sh
   gedit sum_1ton.c
   ```

   ![s2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4988890-b199-42e9-b019-89f7064a3a99)
   
   3. Save your changes and compile the program with the following commands:
      
   ``` sh
   gcc sum_1ton.c
   ./a.out
   ```

   ![s4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c9efc95-21fc-4adc-9f4d-19d888500e7f)
   
   Compilation and execution are now complete.
   
   ### Lab 2: Programming with RISC-V
   #### Compiling a Program Using the RISC-V GCC Compiler
   1. Confirm that the RISC-V GCC compiler is installed and properly set up on your system.
   2. Check the contents of the .c file using the cat command:
      
      ``` sh
      cat sum_1ton.c
      ```
      
      ![s6](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e37bf503-24ff-4fa8-b954-18cb81f32682)
      
   4. Compile the program for RISC-V architecture with the following command:
      
      ``` sh
      riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64 -march=rv64i -o sum_1ton.o sum_1ton.c
      ```
   6. To view the assembly code, disassemble the compiled object file:
      
      ``` sh
      riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum_1ton.o
      ```
      
      ![s12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/74485935-6d5d-44a9-9f0a-18141b5da482)
      
   8. Use the /main search command in the terminal to find the main function in the disassembled output.

## RISC-V ISA Simulation with SPIKE
This repository offers guidance on setting up and using SPIKE, a RISC-V ISA simulator, along with the Proxy Kernel (pk) for executing programs. It includes detailed instructions to install the required tools, perform simulations, and debug RISC-V programs efficiently. Follow the steps provided to get started with RISC-V development using SPIKE.

## About SPIKE
SPIKE is a C++-based open-source simulator for the RISC-V ISA. It provides an efficient environment for testing and debugging RISC-V programs, offering support for both standalone applications and complete operating systems like Linux, without requiring physical hardware.

## Simulating RISC-V with SPIKE
To verify the setup, compile and run a sample program (`sum_1ton.c`) using both the GCC compiler and the RISC-V toolchain.
### Using GCC Compiler:
~~~ sh
gcc add.c
./a.out
~~~

### Using RISC-V Compiler:
``` sh
spike pk add.o
```
## Analyzing the Assembly Code
### Objdump Analysis:
Generate the corresponding assembly code using the following command:
``` sh
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum_1ton.o | less
```
![VirtualBox_vdsworkshop_13_01_2025_19_54_18](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9434e51b-379a-431e-ac19-4fb4e9031e41)

### Debugging with SPIKE:
1. Open the debugger using the command:
``` sh
spike -d pk product.o
```
2. Perform debugging operations in the terminal.
## Optimization Levels
Snapshots of the RISC-V object dump at various optimization levels (-O1 and -Ofast) offer valuable insights into the impact of compiler optimizations on the generated assembly code. Use these options during compilation to examine the differences.

-O1 Optimization

-Ofast Optimization

# Understanding RISC-V and Its Instruction Formats
## Understanding RISC-V and Its Instruction Formats

### About RISC-V
RISC-V is an open-source Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) designed to empower developers in creating processors optimized for specific applications. Rooted in the Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) principles, RISC-V marks the fifth iteration of processors developed under this concept. Its open and license-free model allows developers to use RISC-V without incurring licensing fees, offering an attractive alternative to proprietary processor technologies.

### RISC-v Instruction Formats
The instruction format of a processor specifies the structure of machine language instructions for execution. These instructions consist of binary code (0s and 1s), with each segment indicating details about data locations and the operations to execute. In RISC-V, there are six main instruction formats:
1. **R-format**
2. **I-format**
3. **S-format**
4. **B-format**
5. **U-format**
6. **J-format**

   ![instruction_formats](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a661f728-f5d5-493d-a4d9-d4a79b53618a)

Letâ€™s examine each format in detail.
